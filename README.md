# EdgePrice
Hackathon Project at PSL by Team Regex.

# Problem Description : 
It can be hard to know how much something is really worth. Small details can mean big differences in pricing of a product. For example, two similar product with minor differences in their descriptions can be very different in price.Product pricing gets even harder at scale, considering just how many products are sold online. The pricing also has strong seasonal pricing trends and is also heavily influenced by features like brand names and type of product (Electronics, Clothing etc)
Our solution will be offering pricing suggestions to sellers, but it is tough because sellers are enabled to put just about anything for sale.
The target is to automatically suggest the right product prices, given user-inputted text description of their products, including details like product category name, brand name and item condition.
 
 
# Technology Stack :

2. Angular and Bootstrap for UI, handling receiving of product description.
3. Python flask to bind above two end points.
